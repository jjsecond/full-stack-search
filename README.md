# Accommodation Search

## Technical Coding Test

This project has a simple setup with an api, hooked up to MongoDB and a frontend piece initiated with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Install and run

From the project root:

```
npm install
```

### Run

Once install has finished, you can use the following to run both the API and UI:

```
npm run start
```

### API

To run the API separately, navigate to the `./packages/api` folder

```
$ cd packages/api
```

And run the `api` server with

```
$ npm run dev
```

The API should start at http://localhost:3001

### Client

To run the `client` server separately, navigate to the `./packages/client` folder

```
$ cd ./packages/client
```

And run the `client` with

```
$ npm run start
```

The UI should start at http://localhost:3000

### Database connection & environment variables

By default, the code is set up to start and seed a MongoDB in-memory server, which should be sufficient for the test. The database URL will be logged on startup, and the seed data can be found at ./packages/api/db/seeds.

If this setup does not work for you or if you prefer to use your own MongoDB server, you can create a .env file. In the ./packages/api folder, create a .env file (or rename the existing .env.sample) and fill in the environment variables.

## Task at hand

When the project is up and running, you should see a search-bar on the screen. This one is currently hooked up to the `/hotels` endpoint.
When you type in a partial string that is part of the name of the hotel, it should appear on the screen.
Ie. type in `resort` and you should see some Hotels where the word `resort` is present.

You will also see 2 headings called **"Countries"** and **"Cities"**.

The assignment is to build a performant way to search for Hotels, Cities or Countries.
Partial searches will be fine. Hotels will need to filterable by location as well.
Ie. The search `uni` should render

- Hotels that are located in the United States, United Kingdom or have the word `uni` in the hotel name.
- Countries that have `uni` in their name Ie. United States, United Kingdom
- No Cities as there is no match

Clicking the close button within the search field should clear out the field and results.

When clicking on one of the `Hotels`, `Cities` or `Countries` links, the application should redirect to the relevant page and render the selected `Hotel`, `City` or `Country` as a heading.

### Limitations

Given the time constraints, we do not expect a fully production-ready solution. We're primarily interested in the approach and the overall quality of the solution. 
Feel free to modify the current codebase as needed, including adding or removing dependencies. 
For larger or more time-intensive changes, you're welcome to outline your ideas in the write-up section below and discuss them further during the call.

### Write-up

### MongoDB and Api Performance

To make the query for the hotels, cities and countries performant I opted to combine them on the api side. 

I could have made three independent calls to fetch data, but that would require multiple requests from the client, increasing complexity in handling different endpoints, potential performance impacts, and additional error handling.

While this approach isn’t strictly RESTful, it reduces the workload on the client—whether web or mobile—and should be more efficient overall with less logic for a client/consumer to implement.

For partial searches, I opted for a regex search on the collections. I chose not to index these fields since indexing offers little benefit for regex-based searches. Additionally, I used projections to ensure that only the necessary data is sent to the client, reducing memory usage on the API side and preventing MongoDB from loading unnecessary data.

To further optimize performance, I applied a limit of 5 results. This not only keeps the response neater on the frontend but also prevents MongoDB from retrieving more documents than necessary so should improve performance.

On the frontend, there was logic to validate fields, but I didn’t have time to refactor this. Ideally, I would move this validation to middleware on the API. This would ensure proper request handling, with any errors logged for further inspection.

#### Other Technologies and Solutions Considered

I acknowledge that regex searches in MongoDB are not the most performant solution. In the future, I would consider integrating Elasticsearch or MongoDB Atlas with N-grams for improved efficiency.

#### Possible Improvements

An alternative, if sticking solely with MongoDB, would be to refine the search by first filtering by country, then city, before querying hotels. Indexing country and city names (or codes) on the hotel collection could significantly reduce the dataset size, improving overall query performance. 

Depends on the requirements though.

    "addressline2": "",
    "zipcode": "21160",
    "city": "Koh Samet",
    "state": "Rayong",
    "country": "Thailand",
    "countryisocode": "TH",
    "star_rating": 4
  },
  {
    /* ... */
  }
]
```

#### Cities Collection

```json
[
  { "name": "Auckland" },
  {
    /* ... */
  }
]
```

#### Countries Collection

```json
